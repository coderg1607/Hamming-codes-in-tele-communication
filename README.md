# Hamming-codes-in-tele-communication
 The hamming coding is  very much important for error less data transmission and it has number of real world application. Hamming coding is the most important part of communication because without encoding your message and tailoring it to your audience you shall never achieve the true goal of communication that is understanding and change.so mathematically we describe the various coding schemes.For that we follow some specific procedure to encode and decode the message so we can minimize the errors. Hamming coding is mostly accomplished by selectively introducing redundant bits into the transmitted information stream. These additional bits will allow detection and correction of bit errors in the received data stream and provide more reliable information transmission. The cost of using channel coding to protect the information is a reduction in data rate or an expansion in bandwidth
